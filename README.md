### 👋 Hi, I’m @theroycode

I’m a curious and driven developer exploring the space between **backend systems**, **AI**, and **problem solving**. I thrive on breaking down complex problems and building robust, efficient solutions.

---

### 🧠 Current Focus
- Learning **Golang** for scalable backend development
- Exploring **LangChain** and LLM-powered tools
- Deepening problem-solving and data structures in **Java** 

---

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

#### Programming Languages
- **Python**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, **Go** (learning)

#### Machine Learning / Data
- **NumPy**, **Pandas**, familiar with ML/LLM concepts (RAG, LoRA, vector DBs)

#### Web & Backend
- **Express.js**, REST APIs, request lifecycles, authentication

#### Developer Environment
- Linux-first: Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora
- CLI native: `bash`, `nvim`, `tmux`, `git`, `curl`
